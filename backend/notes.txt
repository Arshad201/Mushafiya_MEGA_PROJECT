Mistakes
1. You're using app.use(cors()) but your cors import is commented.
2. Give a proper messae when server is successfully running (Like => Server is running on the PORT: 4000)
3. You're using un-necessary packages like copy to clipboard. Never install packages for small task, you should write your function of copy to clipboard
4. Never use Empty input in form during development because we have to fill form again n again when project is completed you can remove values from useState({email: "", password:  ""})
5. I don't like concurrently that's why i uninstalled,
